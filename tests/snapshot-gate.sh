# [Kaori-Chani] The snapshot module's gates that need GCC or Clang, in one run: the sanitized test
# suite, the 100% coverage gate, and the fuzzer on every frame width. Each gate runs even if an
# earlier one fails, so one session reports all of them; the exit code is nonzero if any failed.
#
# Usage:   bash tests/snapshot-gate.sh
#   ZX_SNAP_REFDIR=/path   also decode ref.zsnap and ref.csnap (else those two report not-run)
#   SNAP_FUZZ_INPUTS=N     inputs for the long fuzzer run (default 500000; 0 skips it)
#   SKIP_COVERAGE=1        skip the coverage gate, which rebuilds under Clang instrumentation

# net-snapshot

The snapshot netcode: a server sends each client the world as a diff of entity state per frame over
its own unreliable datagrams, and a client draws mirrors of what it has not simulated. It is a sixth
netcode module beside `net-transport`, `net-protocol`, `net-replication`, `net-client` and
`net-session`.

Ported from the `snapshot` branch of Kaori-Chani/ZanZan, from its `snap-ref-premerge` tag at
`b8a72a262`, where it was written against a 32-bit 16.16 `fixed_t`. The quantizers here are rewritten
for `zx::Fixed`; what that found is in the port's own notes, and the shape to watch for is an
unsigned value widened into a `fixed_t` without saying which sign it carries.

**Only the format layer is here so far.** The wire format, the two containers and the pure
`Compute*` units are in, with nothing in the engine's build and no stock file touched: the module is
reached only by the test target. The server, the client, the movers and the recorder follow, and
the hooks that call them after that.

## Owns

No vendored file. The module is its own folder, and each hook in a stock file is one call into it
with any role test or send behind that call, so no stock file's crossings grow and
`tools/boundary-allow.json` needs no raised allowance. The module's README joins the `owners` of the
netcode rules in `tools/boundary-rules.json` when those hooks land, not before.

## Public header

`format.h` is the wire: every record and event, the position frame, the quantizers and the
checksum. `stream.h` reads a `.zsnap`, the server's recording, whose records are zstd frames.
`record.h` is the `.csnap`, the client's recording, with its reader here and its writer to come.

## Files

- `format.h`: the format itself, header-only. Positions are quantized into a frame per map (an
  origin in whole units and a width per axis), so a map past 65,535 units a side sends two or three
  bytes an axis instead of wrapping. Its own wire stays 32-bit on purpose: a 48.16 `fixed_t` is read
  through `ReadFixed32`, which sign-extends, and mover planes, distances and polyobject speeds stay
  absolute 32-bit 16.16 like ForkUnderA's own sector commands.
- `stream.{h,cpp}`: the `.zsnap` container's reader, which needs the vendored zstd.
- `record.h`, `recordread.cpp`: the `.csnap` container and its engine-free reader, which the fuzzer
  and the replay both read through.
- `fuzzgen.h`: the generator the fuzzer builds inputs with, shared with the in-engine fuzzer to come.
- `computation/`: twelve pure units — the ack ledger, the animation census, the budget and chunk
  cuts, the clock model, the interest tiers, the join's frame and map stamp, the gravity law and run
  steps, the mover write order, the replay's histogram, the ghost sampler, the smoothing, and the
  wall sweep — each with its colocated `*_test.cpp`.
- `format_test.cpp`: the format layer's own tests, narrow frame and wide.
- `refdump_test.cpp`: the reference decode, below.

## In-engine hooks

None yet. The format layer is engine-free and nothing in `src/` calls it; the hooks arrive with the
layers that need them and are listed here as they do.

## The reference recordings

Three recordings made on the source tree at its `snap-ref-premerge` tag pin what the format layer
decodes to, byte for byte, through the dumper that wrote their shipped dumps
(`refdump_test.cpp`, which is `snap_dump` with its `main` replaced).

`testdata/ref-wide.csnap` is committed, at 67 KB, and so is checked on every build: it is the only
reference carrying wide frames and non-zero origins, where 48.16 is likeliest to go wrong. The two
large recordings, `ref.zsnap` and `ref.csnap`, are 61 MB with their dumps and stay out of the repo;
set `ZX_SNAP_REFDIR` to the folder holding them and their `.dump.txt` files to run those two:

```
ZX_SNAP_REFDIR=/path/to/references ctest --test-dir build-tests -R SnapshotRefDump
```

Unset, those two report that they did not run, and say that a skip is not a pass. Set but wrong,
they fail: each recording's own SHA-256 is checked before it is decoded, so a damaged or mistaken
file fails as the wrong file rather than as a decode difference. A mismatching dump is written into
the build folder and the first differing line is named.

## The fuzzer

`snap_fuzz` lives at `tests/snapfuzz/fuzz.cpp` rather than here: a non-engine program with its own
`main`, whose sanitizers are build flags that must not reach the rest of the test binary. It is
built behind `ZANDROX_SNAP_FUZZ` on GCC and Clang, with `ZANDROX_SNAP_FUZZ_LIBFUZZER` for the
libFuzzer mode, and CTest runs 20,000 inputs at its fixed seed plus the wide-reference mode on every
build. The long runs on both widths are a gate someone runs by hand.

`--wide-reference` writes a fresh wide reference and reads it back. It is not compared with the
committed `ref-wide.csnap` and cannot be: the generator fills its structs a byte at a time from one
deterministic stream, and `SnapMoverPlat` is 48 bytes here where a 32-bit `fixed_t` made it 32, so
every draw from the first mover record on differs. The committed copy stays the reference.

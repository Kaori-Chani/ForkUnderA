// Description: The server's reading of a client's ack: whether it is read at
// all, whether its history covers everything since the last one, and the
// verdict on each pending datagram it reaches. Pure: sv_snapclient.cpp walks
// the client's pending datagrams, folds the delivered, repairs the lost and
// counts both by what these return. Also the ack lag each datagram echoes,
// and the client's test of whether the server had repaired every loss before
// a datagram when it built it, which decides whether its checksums count.

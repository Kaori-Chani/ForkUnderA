// Description: The server's interest scoring (design doc section 5.2): the
// band each dirty record of a client's frame goes in, by priority hint,
// distance, facing, age and the interest cull, and a branch event's copies
// and deadline. Pure: sv_snapclient.cpp reads the settings and the view,
// counts what the classifier returns, and drains the bands.
//
// Every dirty entity is placed in one of SNAPCL_TIERS bands, and the bands
// are drained in order until the budget runs out. Bands rather than a sort,
// because this runs per client per tic and the extra precision buys
// nothing. The aging term makes it safe: anything unsent for long enough
// climbs to the top band wherever it is, so the worst-case refresh interval
// is bounded however the rest of the scoring behaves.

// Description: The mirrors' error smoothing: one frame of the offset that
// carries a ghost from where it was drawn to its new target, which stepped
// ghosts it applies to, which threshold an extrapolated ghost takes by its
// kind, what it reads of a sampled pose, and for a ghost it leaves alone, the
// renderer's slide over the tic. Pure: cl_ghostactor.cpp and cl_replay.cpp own
// the state and the census.

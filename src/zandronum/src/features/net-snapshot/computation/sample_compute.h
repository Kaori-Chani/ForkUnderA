// Description: The client's sampler: where a ghost is drawn at a render
// time, from its newest records, extrapolated where the server flagged the
// motion predictable, and the dated-ahead curve between two records. Pure:
// cl_entities.cpp gathers the ghost's inputs and counts what the sampler
// returns.
